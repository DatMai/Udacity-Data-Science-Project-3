### Project Motivation
In this project, my main objective was to analyze user interactions with articles on the IBM Watson Studio platform and provide personalized recommendations for new articles. The project was broken down into several tasks, including:

- Exploratory Data Analysis
- Rank Based Recommendations
- User-User Based Collaborative Filtering
- Matrix factorisation
